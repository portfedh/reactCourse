            <Search />

        Structural components

            Pages, layouts, screens

            <App />

            <NavBar />

    Prop Drilling

        Lifting state to parent component

        passing state to child components

        Accepting stat to child component

        Doing that several levels deep

    Component Composition )

        <Component>
            <Other/>
        <Component/>

        function Component({children}) {}

        Avoids having to use prop drilling
